# Depth_analysis
In this repository you find scripts used to parse depth differences between populations/samples (mostly pool-seq)


detect-regions-by-abs-M.Val-V7-with-dynamic-M.Val-Flag.pl

By this script you can define blocks with significant differences between groups by providing p-value and m-value cut-off. 
This script is quite flexible in terms of input file format. You can provide column numbers consisting of p-value and m-value.
